## Brutally honest advice
If you:
- Can deploy Vite to GitHub Pages
- Can explain `base` path
- Can maintain a clean README

👉 You are **above average** already.

If you want next:
- Vercel deploy (better than GitHub Pages)
- README that recruiters love
- Badges + screenshots
- CI deploy via GitHub Actions

Say exactly which one.
